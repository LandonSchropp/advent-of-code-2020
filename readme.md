# Advent of Code 2020

These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) problems. To run
a problem, call the script with `ruby`.

``` bash
ruby day1/part1.rb
```

This outputs how to use the command:

``` text
Usage: ruby day1/day1.rb <combination-size> <file-path>
```

You can then pass the required arguments.

``` bash
ruby day1/part1.rb 2 day1/input.txt
```
