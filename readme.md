# Advent of Code 2020

These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) problems. To run
a problem, call the script with `ruby`. Scripts usually require the path to the input file as the
last argument, and may require other arguments as well.

For example, to run Day 1 Part 1, you'd do the following:

``` bash
ruby day1/part1.rb 2 day1/input.txt
```
